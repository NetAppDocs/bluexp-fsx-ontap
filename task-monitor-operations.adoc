Monitor and track the execution of FSx for ONTAP operations and monitor job progress with Tracker in BlueXP.

.About this task 
BlueXP provides Tracker, a job monitoring feature, so you can monitor and track the progress and status of credentials, FSx for ONTAP, and link operations, review details for operation tasks and subtasks, diagnose any issues or failures, edit parameters for failed operations, and retry failed operations. 

Several actions are available in Tracker. You can filter jobs by time frame (last 24 hours, 7 days, 14 days, or 30 days), workload, status, and user; find jobs using the search function; and download the jobs table as a CSV file. You can refresh Tracker at any time. And you can quickly retry a failed operation or edit parameters for a failed operation and try the operation again. 

Tracker supports two levels of monitoring. Each task such as creating a file system displays the task description, status, start time, task duration, user, region, proxy resource (link association), task ID, and all related sub tasks.  

Tracker task levels with examples::: 

* Level 1 (parent task): Tracks file system deployment.
* Level 2 (sub task): Tracks the sub tasks related to file system deployment. 

Operation status:::
Operation status in Tracker is as follows _in progress_, _success_, and _failed_.

Operation frequency:::
