After you create or discover an FSx for ONTAP working environment in BlueXP, you can manage the file system by creating volumes, managing storage VMs, protecting data, and administering the file system. BlueXP also enables you to use data services that provide capabilities like backup and recovery, data classification, data synchronization, and more.

== Manage a file system using BlueXP workload factory

When you open an FSx for ONTAP working environment from the BlueXP canvas, you're brought to BlueXP workload factory. Workload factory is an intelligent optimization and automation service that uses industry best practices to design, set up, and operate key workloads using Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP.

== Manage a file system using ONTAP System Manager

You can manage an FSx for ONTAP file system directly from BlueXP by using the ONTAP System Manager interface. A Connector is required to use System Manager.

== Manage a file system using Amazon CloudFormation

You can provision and manage FSx for ONTAP file system resources (volumes, CIFS shares, export policies, and more) using Amazon CloudFormation.

== Use BlueXP data services with a file system

Use BlueXP data services with your FSx for ONTAP file systems to back up and recover your data, transfer and synchronize data, scan and classify your data, replicate data, and speed up access or offload traffic.

=== Back up and recover your data

The BlueXP backup and recovery service provides efficient, secure, and cost-effective data protection for NetApp ONTAP data, databases, and virtual machines, both on-premises and in the cloud.

=== Replicate data

BlueXP replication enables you to replicate data between ONTAP storage systems to support backup and disaster recovery to the cloud or between clouds.

=== Speed up access or offload traffic

BlueXP volume caching provides a persistent, writable volume in a remote place. You can use BlueXP volume caching to speed up access to data or to offload traffic from heavily accessed volumes.
