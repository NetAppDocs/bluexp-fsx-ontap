BlueXP enables you to manage your FSx for ONTAP working environment. You can enable automatic capacity management, change throughput and storage capacity and IOPS, remove or delete the working environment, and manage data services such as backup and recovery, copy and sync, classification, replication, and volume caching. 

== Manage automatic capacity

You can choose to enable automatic capacity management to add incremental storage  based on demand. Automatic capacity management polls the cluster at regular intervals to assess demand and automatically increases storage capacity in increments of 10% up to 80% of the the cluster's maximum capacity. 

NOTE: If you did not manually specify an IOPS value when creating the working environment, BlueXP will increase the IOPS by 3 IOPS per GiB of the new total capacity. If you specified an IOPS value, BlueXP will not adjust the IOPS. For details on configuring IOPS, refer to link:task-creating-fsx-working-environment.html#create-an-fsx-for-ontap-working-environment[create a working environment].

Automatic capacity management is disabled by default. You can manage automatic capacity with or without an active Connector in AWS. 

=== Manage automatic capacity without an active Connector
You can manage automatic capacity without an active Connector in AWS. 

.Steps

. Select the working environment on the canvas and select *Enter Working Environment*. 
. Select the pencil icon (image:icon-pencil.png[Image of the pencil edit icon.]) to open the *Automatic capacity management* page.
+
NOTE: All other options require a Connector and are disabled. 

* Select the box to enable automatic capacity management. 
* Deselect the box to disable automatic capacity management if it was previously enabled.
. Select *Apply*.


=== Manage automatic capacity with an active Connector
You can manage automatic capacity with an active Connector in AWS. 

.Steps

. Open the FSx for ONTAP working environment. 
. From the *Overview* tab, select *Features*. 
. Select the pencil icon (image:icon-pencil.png[Image of the pencil edit icon.]) to open the *Automatic capacity management* page.
. On the *Automatic capacity management* page: 
* Select the box to enable automatic capacity management. 
* Deselect the box to disable automatic capacity management if it was previously enabled. 
. Select *Apply*.

== Change throughput capacity

You can change the throughput capacity at any time after you create the FSx for ONTAP working environment. 

.Before you begin

You need an active https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-quick-start-connector-aws.html[Connector in AWS^].

.Steps

. Open the FSx for ONTAP working environment. 
. From the *Overview* tab, select *Features*. 
. Select the pencil icon (image:icon-pencil.png[Image of the pencil edit icon.]) to open the *Throughput Capacity* edit page.
. Select a new throughput capacity from the dropdown and select *Update*. This change can take up to 25 minutes to take effect and does not disrupt data access.

== Change storage capacity and IOPS

You can change the storage capacity and IOPS at any time after you create the FSx for ONTAP working environment. 

.Before you begin

You need an active https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-quick-start-connector-aws.html[Connector in AWS^].

.Steps

. Open the FSx for ONTAP working environment. 
. From the *Overview* tab, select *Features*. 
. Select the pencil icon (image:icon-pencil.png[Image of the pencil edit icon.]) to open the *Storage Capacity & IOPS* edit page.
. You can change the storage capacity and IOPS once every six hours. If you attempt to make changes more frequently, you will receive an error.

+
[NOTE]
================
* The recommended maximum storage capacity utilization is 80% to maintain Data Tiering performance and allow capacity for additional data.
* Selecting *Automatic* IOPS maintains a ratio of three provisioned SSD IOPS per GiB of primary storage up to 160,000. You cannot manually provision an IOPS value of greater than 160,000.
================
. Select the checkbox to confirm you understand changing storage capacity impacts the cost of the FSx for ONTAP service and that additional changes cannot be made for six hours. 
. Select *Update* to confirm your changes. 

== Remove FSx for ONTAP from the project or workspace

You can remove FSx for ONTAP from BlueXP without deleting your account or volumes. You can add the FSx for ONTAP working environment back to BlueXP at any time.

.Steps

. Open the working environment. If you don't have a Connector in AWS, you will see the prompt screen. You can ignore this and proceed with removing the working environment.

. At the top right of the page, select the actions menu and select *Remove from workspace*.
+

. Select *Remove* to remove FSx for ONTAP from BlueXP.

== Delete the FSx for ONTAP working environment

You can delete the FSx for ONTAP from BlueXP.

WARNING: This action will delete all resources associated with the working environment. This action cannot be undone.

.Before you begin
Before deleting the working environment, you must: 

* Break all replication relationships with this working environment.
* link:task-manage-fsx-volumes.html#delete-volumes[Delete all volumes] associated with the file system. You will need an active Connector in AWS to remove or delete volumes.
+
NOTE: Failed volumes must be deleted using the AWS Management Console or CLI. 

.Steps

. Open the working environment. If you don't have a Connector in AWS, you will see the prompt screen. You can ignore this and proceed to deleting the working environment.

. At the top right of the page, select the actions menu and select *Delete*.
+

. Enter the name of the working environment and select *Delete*.

== Manage data services

You can manage additional data services from the FSx for ONTAP working environment.
