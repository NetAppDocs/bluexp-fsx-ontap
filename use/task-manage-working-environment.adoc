You need an active https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/task-creating-connectors-aws.html[Connector in AWS^].

.Steps

. Select a new throughput capacity from the dropdown and select *Update*. This change can take up to 25 minutes to take effect and does not disrupt data access.

== Change storage capacity and IOPS

You can change the storage capacity and IOPS at any time after you create the FSx for ONTAP working environment. 

.Before you begin

You need an active https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/task-creating-connectors-aws.html[Connector in AWS^].

.Steps

. Open the FSx for ONTAP working environment.

+
[NOTE]
================
* The recommended maximum storage capacity utilization is 80% to maintain Data Tiering performance and allow capacity for additional data.
* Selecting *Automatic* IOPS maintains a ratio of three provisioned SSD IOPS per GiB of primary storage up to 80,000. You cannot manually provision an IOPS value of 80,000 or greater.
================
. Select the checkbox to confirm you understand changing storage capacity impacts the cost of the FSx for ONTAP service and that additional changes cannot be made for six hours. 
. Select *Update* to confirm your changes.
