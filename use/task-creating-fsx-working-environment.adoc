Using BlueXP you can create or discover an FSx for ONTAP working environment to add and manage volumes and additional data services.

== Create an Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP working environment

The first step is to create an FSx for ONTAP working environment. If you already created an FSx for ONTAP file system in the AWS Management Console, you can link:task-creating-fsx-working-environment.html#discover-an-existing-fsx-for-ontap-file-system[discover it using BlueXP].

.Before you begin

Before creating your FSx for ONTAP working environment in BlueXP, you will need:

* The ARN of an IAM role that gives BlueXP the permissions needed to create an FSx for ONTAP working environment. See link:../requirements/task-setting-up-permissions-fsx.html[adding AWS credentials to BlueXP] for details.

* The region and VPN information for where you will create the FSx for ONTAP instance.

.Steps

. In BlueXP, add a new Working Environment, select *Amazon Web Services*, and click *Add new* for Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP.

. *FSx for ONTAP Authentication* 

.. If there is an existing IAM role in your account with the correct AWS permissions for FSx for ONTAP, select it from the dropdown.

.. If there is no IAM role in your account, click *Credentials* and follow the steps in the wizard to add an ARN for an AWS IAM role with FSx for ONTAP credentials. See link:../requirements/task-setting-up-permissions-fsx.html[adding AWS credentials to BlueXP] for details.

. *Details and Credentials*

.. Enter the working environment name you want to use.
.. Optionally, you can create tags to categorize your working environment by clicking the plus sign and entering a tag name and value.
.. Enter and confirm the ONTAP Cluster password you want to use.
.. Optionally, deselect the option to use the same password for your SVM user and set a different password.

. *HA deployment model*

.. Select a *Single Availability Zone* or *Multiple Availability Zones* HA deployment model. For multiple Availability Zones, select subnets in at least two Availability Zones so each node is in a dedicated Availability Zone.

.. Select the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) you want to associate with your file system.

.. Use an existing security group or select *Generated security group* to enable BlueXP to generate a security group that allows traffic within the selected VPC only. 
+
NOTE: link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-rules.html[AWS security groups^] control inbound and outbound traffic. These are configured by your AWS admin and are associated with your link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html[AWS elastic network interface (ENI)^].

. *Floating IP* (Multiple Availability Zones only)
+
Leave _CIDR Range_ empty to automatically set an available range. Optionally, you can use https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-setting-up-transit-gateway.html[AWS Transit Gateway^] to manually configure a range.
+
[WARNING]
====
.IPs in the following ranges are not supported:
* 0.0.0.0/8
* 127.0.0.0/8
* 198.19.0.0/20
* 224.0.0.0/4
* 240.0.0.0/4
* 255.255.255.255/32
====

. *Route Tables* (Multiple Availability Zones only)
+
Select route tables that include routes to the floating IP addresses. If you have just one route table for the subnets in your VPC (the main route table), BlueXP automatically adds the floating IP addresses to that route table. 

. *Data Encryption*
+
Accept the default AWS master key or click *Change Key* to select a different AWS Customer Master Key (CMK). For more information on CMK, see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-setting-up-kms.html[Setting up the AWS KMS^].  

. *Storage Configuration*

.. Select the throughput, capacity, and unit. You can change throughput, storage capacity, and IOPS at any time. 

.. You can optionally specify an IOPS value. If you don't specify an IOPS value, BlueXP will set a default value based on 3 IOPS per GiB of the total capacity entered. For example, if you enter 2000 GiB for the total capacity and no value for the IOPS, the effective IOPS value will be set to 6000. You can change the IOPS value at any time. 
+
NOTE: If you specify an IOPS value that does not meet the minimum requirements, youâ€™ll receive an error when adding the working environment.

. *Review*

.. Click the tabs to review your ONTAP properties, provider properties, and networking configuration.
.. Click *Previous* to make changes to any settings or *Add* to accept the settings and create your Working Environment.

.Result

BlueXP displays your FSx for ONTAP configuration on the Canvas. You can now add volumes to your FSx for ONTAP working environment using BlueXP.

== Discover an existing FSx for ONTAP file system 

If you previously provided your AWS credentials to BlueXP, *My Opportunities* can automatically discover and suggest FSx for ONTAP file systems to add and manage using BlueXP. You can also review available data services. 

.About this task
You can discover FSx for ONTAP file systems when you <<Create an Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP working environment>> or by using the *My Opportunities* page. This task describes discovery using *My Opportunities*

.Steps

. In BlueXP, click the *My Opportunities* tab. 

. The count of discovered FSx for ONTAP file systems displays. Click *Discover*.  
+

. Select one or more file systems and click *Discover* to add them to the Canvas. 

[NOTE]
===============================
* If you select an un-named cluster, you will receive a prompt to enter a name for the cluster.

* If you select a cluster that doesn't have the credentials required to allow BlueXP to manage the FSx for ONTAP file system, you'll receive a prompt to select credentials with the required permissions. 
===============================

.Result

BlueXP displays your discovered FSx for ONTAP file system on the Canvas. You can now add volumes to your FSx for ONTAP working environment using BlueXP.
