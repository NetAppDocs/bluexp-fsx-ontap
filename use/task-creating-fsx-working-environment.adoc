Using Cloud Manager you can create or discover an FSx for ONTAP working environment to add and manage volumes and additional data services.

== Create an Amazon FSx for ONTAP working environment

The first step is to create an FSx for ONTAP working environment. If you already created an FSx for ONTAP file system in the AWS Management Console, you can link:task-creating-fsx-working-environment.html#discover-an-existing-fsx-for-ontap-file-system[discover it using Cloud Manager].

.Before you begin

Before creating your FSx for ONTAP working environment in Cloud Manager, you will need:

* The ARN of an IAM role that gives Cloud Manager the permissions needed to create an FSx for ONTAP working environment. See link:../requirements/task-setting-up-permissions-fsx.html[adding AWS credentials to Cloud Manager] for details.

* The region and VPN information for where you will create the FSx for ONTAP instance.

.Steps

. In Cloud Manager, add a new Working Environment, select the location *Amazon Web Services*, and click *Next*.

. Select *Amazon FSx for ONTAP* and click *Next*.

. Authenticate FSx for ONTAP in Cloud Manager.

.. If there is an existing IAM role in your account with the correct AWS permissions for FSx for ONTAP, select it from the dropdown.
+

.. If there is no IAM role in your account, click *Credentials Page* and follow the steps in the wizard to add an ARN for an AWS IAM role with FSx for ONTAP credentials. See link:../requirements/task-setting-up-permissions-fsx.html[adding AWS credentials to Cloud Manager] for details.
+

. Provide information about your FSx for ONTAP instance:

.. Enter the working environment name you want to use.
.. Optionally, you can create tags by clicking the plus sign and entering a tag name and value.
.. Enter and confirm the ONTAP Cluster password you want to use.
.. Select the option to use the same password for your SVM user or set a different password.
.. Click *Next*.

. Provide region and VPC information:

.. Select a *Single Availability Zone* or *Multiple Availability Zones* HA deployment model.
+

.. Select a region and VPC. 
+
[NOTE] 
================
For multiple Availability Zones, select subnets in at least two Availability Zones so each node is in a dedicated Availability Zone.

================

.. Accept the default security group or select a different one. link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-rules.html[AWS security groups^] control inbound and outbound traffic. These are configured by your AWS admin and are associated with your link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html[AWS elastic network interface (ENI)^].
.. Click *Next*.


. Leave _CIDR Range_ empty and click *Next* to automatically set an available range. Optionally, you can use https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-setting-up-transit-gateway.html[AWS Transit Gateway^] to manually configure a range.
+

. Select route tables that include routes to the floating IP addresses. If you have just one route table for the subnets in your VPC (the main route table), Cloud Manager automatically adds the floating IP addresses to that route table. Click *Next* to continue.
+

. Accept the default AWS master key or click *Change Key* to select a different AWS Customer Master Key (CMK). For more information on CMK, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-cloud-volumes-ontap/https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/occm/task-setting-up-kms.html[Setting up the AWS KMS^]. Click *Next* to continue.

. Configure your storage:

.. Select the throughput, capacity, and unit. You can change the throughput capacity at any time. 
.. You can optionally specify an IOPS value. If you don't specify an IOPS value, Cloud Manager will set a default value based on 3 IOPS per GiB of the total capacity entered. For example, if you enter 2000 GiB for the total capacity and no value for the IOPS, the effective IOPS value will be set to 6000.
+
WARNING: If you specify an IOPS value that does not meet the minimum requirements, you'll receive an error when adding the working environment.

.. Click *Next*.

. Review your configuration:

.. Click the tabs to review your ONTAP properties, provider properties, and networking configuration.
.. Click *Previous* to make changes to any settings.
.. Click *Add* to accept the settings and create your Working Environment.
+

.Result

Cloud Manager displays your FSx for ONTAP configuration on the Canvas page.

You can now add volumes to your FSx for ONTAP working environment using Cloud Manager.

== Discover an existing FSx for ONTAP file system 

If you created an FSx for ONTAP file system using the AWS Management Console or want to restore a working environment you previously removed, you can discover it using **My Opportunities** or manually.

=== Discover using My Opportunities

If you previously provided your AWS credentials to Cloud Manager, *My Opportunities* can automatically discover and suggest FSx for ONTAP file systems to add and manage using Cloud Manager. You can also review available data services. 

.Steps

. In Cloud Manager, click the *My Opportunities* tab. 

. The count of discovered FSx for ONTAP file systems displays. Click *Discover*.  
+

. Select one or more file systems and click *Discover* to add them to the Canvas. 

[NOTE]
===============================
* If you select an un-named cluster, you will receive a prompt to enter a name for the cluster.

* If you select a cluster that doesn't have the credentials required to allow Cloud Manager to manage the FSx for ONTAP file system, you'll receive a prompt to select credentials with the required permissions. 
===============================

=== Discover manually
You can manually discover an FSx for ONTAP file system you added using the AWS Management Console or that you previously removed from Cloud Manager.
