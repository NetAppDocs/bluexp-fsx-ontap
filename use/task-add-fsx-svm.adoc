After you set up your working environment, you can view existing storage virtual machines (VMs) on a managed cluster or add a new storage VM to the Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP cluster. 

== Add an SVM
Using BlueXP, you can add storage VMs to the Amazon FSx for ONTAP file system up to the maximum number allowed. Refer to link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/managing-svms.html[AWS: Managing FSx for ONTAP storage virtual machines^] for details.

.Before you begin
* You need an active https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-creating-connectors-aws.html[Connector in AWS^].

* Create one or more storage VMs. Refer to link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-managing-svms.html[Manage storage VMs in BlueXP^] for details. 

.About this task
You can add an SVM by opening the working environment and selecting the *Storage VMs* tab or from the working environment *Overview* panel. This task describes adding volumes using the *Storage VMs* panel. 

.Steps

. Select the FSx for ONTAP working environment on the Canvas. If you don't have a Connector enabled, you'll be prompted to add one.

.. Optionally, create up to fifty tags to categorize your volumes by clicking the plus sign and entering a tag name and value. 
.. Select **Add** to add the storage VM.  

.Result

The new storage VM is added to the working environment and the Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file system.
