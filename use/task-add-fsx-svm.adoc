[.lead]
After you create your working environment, you can add, view, and manage a storage virtual machine (VM)--also referred to as an _SVM_--on a managed Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP cluster. 

== Add a storage VM
Using BlueXP, you can add storage VMs to the Amazon FSx for ONTAP file system up to the maximum number allowed. Refer to link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/managing-svms.html[AWS: Managing FSx for ONTAP storage virtual machines^] for details.

.About this task
You can add a storage VM by opening the working environment and selecting the *Storage VMs* tab or from the working environment *Overview* panel. This task describes adding a storage VM using the *Storage VMs* panel. 

.Before you begin
* You need an active https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-creating-connectors-aws.html[Connector in AWS^].

* Create one or more storage VMs. Refer to link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-managing-svms.html[Manage storage VMs in BlueXP^] for details. 

.Steps

. Select the FSx for ONTAP working environment on the Canvas. If you don't have a Connector enabled, you'll be prompted to add one.

. Select the *Storage VMs* panel. Existing SVMs are displayed. Select **Add SVM** to add a new SVM.

. *Add storage virtual machine*

.. Enter the name of your storage VM.
.. Select the configured storage VM root volume security style. Valid values are **UNIX**, **NTFS**, or **Mixed**. 
.. Optionally, specify a storage VM administrative password.
.. Optionally, create up to fifty tags to categorize your SVM by clicking the plus sign and entering a tag name and value. 
.. Select **Add** to add the storage VM.  

.Result

The new storage VM is added to the working environment and the Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file system. 

== Manage a storage VM
You can view storage VM details, manage tags, set up an SMB/CIFS connection, or delete a storage SVM.

.Before you begin
You need an active https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-creating-connectors-aws.html[Connector in AWS^].

.Steps

. Select the FSx for ONTAP working environment on the Canvas. If you don't have a Connector enabled, you'll be prompted to add one.

. Select the *Storage VMs* panel. 

. Use the three dots (image:icon-three-dots.png[icon of three dots]) to open the options menu for the storage VM. 
+

. Select a menu option to view or manage the storage VM settings. 
* **View SVM details**: You can review details including root volume, security style, allowed protocols, Active Directory domain, and tags. 
* **Manage SVM tags**: You can add, edit, or remove storage VM tags. Changes you make will sync with the AWS Console.  
* **Set up SMB/CIFS**: If this is the first CIFS connection for this working environment, you will be prompted to configure CIFS connectivity using an _Active Directory_ or _Workgroup_ setup.

** If you select a Workgroup setup, enter the server and workgroup name for a workgroup configured for CIFS.
** If you select an Active Directory setup, you'll need to provide the following configuration information.

| Field
| Description

| DNS Primary IP Address | The IP addresses of the DNS servers that provides name resolution for the CIFS server.
The listed DNS server must contain the service location records (SRV) needed to locate the Active Directory LDAP servers and domain controllers for the domain the CIFS server will join.

| Active Directory Domain to join | The FQDN of the Active Directory (AD) domain you want the CIFS server to join.

| Credentials authorized to join the domain | The name and password of a Windows account with sufficient privileges to add computers to the specified Organizational Unit (OU) within the AD domain.

| CIFS server NetBIOS name | A CIFS server name that is unique in the AD domain.

| Organizational Unit | The organizational unit within the AD domain to associate with the CIFS server. The default is CN=Computers.

| DNS Domain | The DNS domain for the storage virtual machine (SVM). In most cases, the domain is the same as the AD domain.

| NTP Server | Select *Enable NTP Server Configuration* to configure an NTP server using the Active Directory DNS. If you need to configure an NTP server using a different address, then you should use the API. See the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-automation/index.html[BlueXP automation docs^] for details.

* **Delete SVM**: You can delete the storage VM. You must verify the storage VM name to delete it.

NOTE: You must delete all volumes on the storage VM before deleting the storage VM.
