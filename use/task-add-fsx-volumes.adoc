After you set up your working environment, you can create and mount FSx for ONTAP volumes.

== Create volumes

You can create and manage NFS, CIFS, and iSCSI volumes from your FSx for ONTAP working environment in Cloud Manager. Volumes created using ONTAP CLI will also be visible in your FSx for ONTAP working environment.

.Before you begin

You need:

* An active https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/task-creating-connectors-aws.html[Connector in AWS^].

* If you want to use SMB, you must have set up DNS and Active Directory. For more information on DNS and Active Directory network configuration, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/self-manage-prereqs.html[AWS: Prerequisites for using a self-managed Microsoft AD^].

.Steps

. Open the FSx for ONTAP working environment.

. If you don't have a Connector enabled, you'll be prompted to add one.

. Click the *Volumes* tab

. Click *Add Volume*.
+

. *Volume Details and Protection*:

.. Enter a name for your new volume.
.. The Storage VM (SVM) fields auto-populates the SVM based on the name of your working environment.
.. Enter the volume size and select a unit (GiB or TiB). Note that the volume size will grow with usage.
.. Select a snapshot policy. By default, a snapshot is taken every hour (keeping the last six copies), every day (keeping the last two copies), and every week (keeping the last two copies).

.. Click *Next*.

. *Protocol*: Select the an NFS, CIFS, or iSCSI volume protocol.
.. For NFS:
* Select an Access Control policy.
* Select the NFS versions.
* Select a Custom Export Policy. Click the information icon for valid value criteria.
+

.. For CIFS:
* Enter a Share Name.
* Enter users or groups separated by a semicolon.
* Select the permission level for the volume.

TIP: If this is the first CIFS volume for this working environment, you will be prompted to configure CIFS connectivity using an _Active Directory_ or _Workgroup_ setup.

* If you select an Active Directory setup, you'll need to provide the following configuration information.

|===
| Field
| Description

| DNS Primary IP Address | The IP addresses of the DNS servers that provides name resolution for the CIFS server.
The listed DNS server must contain the service location records (SRV) needed to locate the Active Directory LDAP servers and domain controllers for the domain the CIFS server will join.

| Active Directory Domain to join | The FQDN of the Active Directory (AD) domain you want the CIFS server to join.

| Credentials authorized to join the domain | The name and password of a Windows account with sufficient privileges to add computers to the specified Organizational Unit (OU) within the AD domain.

| CIFS server NetBIOS name | A CIFS server name that is unique in the AD domain.

| Organizational Unit | The organizational unit within the AD domain to associate with the CIFS server. The default is CN=Computers.

| DNS Domain | The DNS domain for the storage virtual machine (SVM). In most cases, the domain is the same as the AD domain.

| NTP Server | Select *Enable NTP Server Configuration* to configure an NTP server using the Active Directory DNS. If you need to configure an NTP server using a different address, then you should use the API. See the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-automation/index.html[Cloud Manager automation docs^] for details.

* If you select a Workgroup setup, enter the server and workgroup name for a workgroup configured for CIFS.

.. For iSCSI:
You can connect your LUN using an existing initiator group or by creating a new one. To map an existing initiator group, select your operating system and one or more initiator groups. 
+

+
To create a new initiator group:

... Select **Create new**.
... Select your operating system.
... Click to add one or more host iSCSI qualified names (IQN). You can select existing IQNs or add new IQNs. For details on how to find the IQN for a volume, see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-connect-lun.html[Connect a host to a LUN^].
... Enter an **Initiator Group Name**.

.. Click *Next*.

. *Usage Profile and Tiering*:

.. By default, *Storage Efficiency* is disabled. You can change this setting to enable deduplication and compression.
.. By default, *Tiering Policy* is set to *Snapshot Only*. You can select a different tiering policy based on your needs.
.. Click *Next*.

. *Review*: Review your volume configuration. Click *Previous* to change settings or click *Add* to create the volume.


.Result

The new volume is added to the working environment.

== Mount volumes

Access mounting instructions from within Cloud Manager so you can mount the volume to a host.

.Steps

. Open the working environment.

. Open the volume menu and select *Mount the volume*.
