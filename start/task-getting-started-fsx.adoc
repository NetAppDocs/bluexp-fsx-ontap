Get started with Amazon FSx for ONTAP in a few steps.

== Quick steps

Using link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-family/[BlueXP^], you can get started with FSx for ONTAP in just a few steps.

.Before you begin
To create or manage an Amazon FSx for ONTAP working environment, you need to add AWS credentials to BlueXP by providing the ARN of an IAM role that gives BlueXP the permissions needed to create an FSx for ONTAP working environment. To do this, you must link:../requirements/task-setting-up-permissions-fsx.html[set up an IAM role that enables the BlueXP SaaS to assume the role].
