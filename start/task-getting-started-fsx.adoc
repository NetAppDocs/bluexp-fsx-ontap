Get started with Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP in BlueXP by adding credentials, creating a Connector or link, and by creating or discovering an FSx for ONTAP file system.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Adding AWS credentials is required to provide BlueXP the permissions needed to create and manage FSx for ONTAP file systems. You can choose between _automate permissions_ and _read permissions_.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
To perform some management tasks from BlueXP, you either need a BlueXP Connector or a BlueXP workload factory link. A _Connector_ is a virtual machine that you deploy in your VPC to manage your FSx for ONTAP file systems. A _link_ leverages AWS Lambda to create a trust relationship and connectivity to your FSx for ONTAP file systems.
