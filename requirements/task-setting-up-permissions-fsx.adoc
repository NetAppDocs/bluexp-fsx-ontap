To create or manage an FSx for ONTAP working environment, you need to add AWS credentials to BlueXP by providing the ARN of an IAM role that gives BlueXP the permissions needed to create an FSx for ONTAP working environment.

== Set up the IAM role

Set up an IAM role that enables BlueXP to assume the role.

.Steps

. Go to the IAM console in the target account.

. Grant BlueXP access to the AWS account. Under Access Management, click *Roles > Create Role* and follow the steps to create the role.
+
* Under *Trusted entity type*, select *AWS account*.
* Select *Another AWS account* and enter the BlueXP *Account ID*: 
** For BlueXP SaaS: 952013314444
** For AWS GovCloud (US): 033442085313

NOTE: For increased security, we suggest you specify an link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html[_External ID_^]. To access your AWS account, BlueXP will have to provide the role ARN (Amazon Resource Name) and the external ID you specified. This prevents the link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/confused-deputy.html[confused deputy problem^]. 
. Create a policy that includes the following required minimum permissions and optional permissions, as needed.

// start tabbed area

[role="tabbed-block"]

// end tabbed area 

. Copy the role ARN of the IAM role so that you can paste it in BlueXP in the next step.

.Result

The IAM role now has the required permissions.

== Add the credentials

After you provide the IAM role with the required permissions, add the role ARN to BlueXP.

.Before you get started

If you just created the IAM role, wait a few minutes for the new credentials to become available. 

.Steps

. In the upper right of the BlueXP console, click the Settings icon, and select *Credentials*.

. Click *Add Credentials* and follow the steps in the wizard.

.. *Credentials Location*: Select *Amazon Web Services > BlueXP*.

.. *Define Credentials*: Provide a *Credentials name* and the *Role ARN* and *External ID* (if specified) you created when you <<Set up the IAM role>>. 
+
[NOTE]
==============
* If you use an AWS GovCloud (US) account, check *I use an AWS GovCloud (US) account*.

* Authenticating using AWS GovCloud will disable the SaaS platform. This is a permanent change to your account and cannot be undone. 
==============

.. *Review*: Confirm the details about the new credentials and click *Add*.

.Result

You can now use the credentials when creating an FSx for ONTAP working environment.
