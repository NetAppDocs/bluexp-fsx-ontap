To create or manage an Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP working environment, you need to add AWS credentials to BlueXP by providing the ARN of an IAM role that gives BlueXP the permissions needed to create an FSx for ONTAP working environment.

== Set up the IAM role

Set up an IAM role that enables BlueXP to assume the role.

.Steps

. Go to the IAM console in the target account.

. Under Access Management, click *Roles > Create Role* and follow the steps to create the role.
+
* Under *Trusted entity type*, select *AWS account*.
* Select *Another AWS account* and enter the ID of BlueXP. 
** For BlueXP SaaS: 952013314444
** For AWS GovCloud (US): 033442085313
* Create a policy that includes the following required minimum permissions and optional permissions, as needed.

. Copy the Role ARN of the IAM role so that you can paste it in BlueXP in the next step.

.Result

The IAM role now has the required permissions.

== Add the credentials

After you provide the IAM role with the required permissions, add the role ARN to BlueXP.

.Before you get started

If you just created the IAM role, it might take a few minutes until they are available for use. Wait a few minutes before you add the credentials to BlueXP.

.Steps

. In the upper right of the BlueXP console, click the Settings icon, and select *Credentials*.
