To create or manage an FSx for ONTAP working environment, you need to add AWS credentials to BlueXP by providing the ARN of an IAM role that gives BlueXP the permissions needed to create an FSx for ONTAP working environment.

== Overview

BlueXP FSx for ONTAP uses the same set of AWS credentials and permissions as in BlueXP workloads. Credentials and permissions are managed via the workloads user interface. 

The main difference for BlueXP FSx for ONTAP users are the options to enable workload capabilities like Storage, VMware, Databases, and GenAI, and to select permissions for the workloads. For FSx for ONTAP, also known as _Storage_ in BlueXP workloads, you'll need to decide which level of permissions, or _operational mode_, you'd like to operate in. link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/operational-modes.html.html[Learn more about operational modes]. BlueXP FSx for ONTAP will operate in _basic_ mode unless you add AWS account credentials. You can add credentials to enable other operational modes, such as Read mode and Automate mode.

NOTE: Existing AWS credentials are available from BlueXP settings > *Credentials* page. Newly added credentials are displayed from Workloads user interface within BlueXP. A link is provided in the BlueXP settings credentials page to help you navigate to the Workloads credentials page.

You can add AWS credentials to an existing BlueXP account from the Credentials page. This provides BlueXP with the permissions needed to manage resources and processes within your AWS cloud environment.

You can add credentials using two methods:

* *Manually*: You create the IAM policy and the IAM role in your AWS account while adding credentials in Workloads. 
* *Automatically*: You capture a minimal amount of information about permissions and then use a CloudFormation stack to create the IAM policies and role for your credentials.

== Add credentials to an account manually

You can add AWS credentials to BlueXP manually to give your account the permissions needed to manage the AWS resources that you'll use to run your unique workloads. Each set of credentials that you add will include one or more IAM policies based on the workload capabilities you want to use, and an IAM role that is assigned to your account.

There are three parts to creating the credentials:

* Select the services and permissions level that you would like to use and then create IAM policies from the AWS Management Console.
* Create an IAM role from the AWS Management Console.
* From Workloads in BlueXP, enter a name and add the credentials.

To create or manage an FSx for ONTAP working environment, you need to add AWS credentials to BlueXP by providing the ARN of an IAM role that gives BlueXP the permissions needed to create an FSx for ONTAP working environment.

.Before you begin

You'll need to have credentials to log in to your AWS account.

.Steps

. In the BlueXP console, select the *Settings* icon, and select *Credentials*. 

. Select *Add credentials*. 

. Select *Amazon Web Services*, then *FSx for ONTAP*, and then *Next*. 
You're now on the *Add Credentials* page in BlueXP workloads. 

. Select *Add manually* and then follow the steps below to fill out the three sections under _Permissions configuration_. 
+
image:screenshot-add-credentials-manually.png[A screenshot showing the items that you need to define manually for each set of credentials.]

=== Step 1: Select the workload capabilities and create the IAM policies

In this section you'll choose which types of workload capabilities will be manageable as part of these credentials, and the permissions enabled for each workload. You'll need to copy the policy permissions for each selected workload from the Codebox and add them into the AWS Management Console within your AWS account to create the policies.

image:screenshot-create-policies-manual.png[A screenshot showing which types of workload capabilities will be manageable as part of the policies in these credentials.]

.Steps

. From the *Create policies* section, enable each of the workload capabilities that you want to include in these credentials. Enable *Storage* to create and manage file systems. 
+
You can add additional capabilities later, so just select the workloads that you currently want to deploy and manage.
. For those workload capabilities that offer a choice of permission levels (automate or read), select the type of permissions that will be available with these credentials. link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/operational-modes.html[Learn about the permissions, or operational modes^]. 

. In the Codebox window, copy the permissions for the first IAM policy.

. Open another browser window and log in to your AWS account in the AWS Management Console.

. Open the IAM service, and then select *Policies* > *Create Policy*.

. Select JSON as the file type, paste the permissions you copied in step 3, and select *Next*.

. Enter the name for the policy and select *Create Policy*.

. If you've selected multiple workload capabilities in step 1, repeat these steps to create a policy for each set of workload permissions.

=== Step 2: Create the IAM role that uses the policies

In this section you'll set up an IAM role that Workload Factory will assume that includes the permissions and policies that you just created.

image:screenshot-create-role.png[A screenshot showing which permissions will be part of the new role.]

.Steps

. In the AWS Management Console, select *Roles > Create Role*.

. Under *Trusted entity type*, select *AWS account*.

.. Select *Another AWS account* and copy and paste the account ID for FSx for ONTAP workload management from the BlueXP workloads UI.
.. Select *Required external ID* and copy and paste the external ID from the BlueXP workloads UI.

. Select *Next*.

. In the Permissions policy section, choose all the policies that you defined previously and select *Next*.

. Enter a name for the role and select *Create role*.

. Copy the Role ARN.

. Return to BlueXP workloads Add credentials page, expand the *Create role* section, and paste the ARN in the _Role ARN_ field.

=== Step 3: Enter a name and add the credentials

The final step is to enter a name for the credentials in BlueXP workloads.

.Steps

. From BlueXP workloads Add credentials page, expand *Credentials name*.

. Enter the name that you want to use for these credentials.

. Select *Add* to create the credentials.

.Result

The credentials are created and you are returned to the Credentials page.

== Add credentials to an account using CloudFormation

You can add AWS credentials to BlueXP workloads using an AWS CloudFormation stack by selecting the workload capabilities that you want to use, and then launching the AWS CloudFormation stack in your AWS account. CloudFormation will create the IAM policies and IAM role based on the workload capabilities you selected.

.Before you begin

* You'll need to have credentials to log in to your AWS account.
* You'll need to have the following permissions in your AWS account when adding credentials using a CloudFormation stack:
+
[source,json]
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "cloudformation:CreateStack",
                "cloudformation:UpdateStack",
                "cloudformation:DeleteStack",
                "cloudformation:DescribeStacks",
                "cloudformation:DescribeStackEvents",
                "cloudformation:DescribeChangeSet",
                "cloudformation:ExecuteChangeSet",
                "cloudformation:ListStacks",
                "cloudformation:ListStackResources",
                "cloudformation:GetTemplate",
                "cloudformation:ValidateTemplate",
                "lambda:InvokeFunction",
                "iam:PassRole",
                "iam:CreateRole",
                "iam:UpdateAssumeRolePolicy",
                "iam:AttachRolePolicy",
                "iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}

.Steps

. In the BlueXP console, select the *Settings* icon, and select *Credentials*. 

. Select *Add credentials*. 

. Select *Amazon Web Services*, then *FSx for ONTAP*, and then *Next*. 
You're now on the *Add Credentials* page in BlueXP workloads. 

. Select *Add via AWS CloudFormation*.
+
image:screenshot-add-credentials-cloudformation.png[A screenshot showing the items that need to be defined before you can launch CloudFormation to create the credentials.]

. Under *Create policies*, enable each of the workload capabilities that you want to include in these credentials and choose a permission level for each workload.
+
You can add additional capabilities later, so just select the workloads that you currently want to deploy and manage.

. Under *Credentials name*, enter the name that you want to use for these credentials.

. Add the credentials from AWS CloudFormation:

.. Select *Add* (or select *Redirect to CloudFormation*) and the Redirect to CloudFormation page is displayed.
+
image:screenshot-redirect-cloudformation.png[A screenshot showing how to create the CloudFormation stack for adding policies and a role for Workload Factory credentials.]

.. If you use single sign-on (SSO) with AWS, open a separate browser tab and log in to the AWS Console before you select *Continue*.
+
You should log in to the AWS account where the FSx for ONTAP file system resides.

.. Select *Continue* from the Redirect to CloudFormation page.

.. On the Quick create stack page, under Capabilities, select *I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources*.

.. Select *Create stack*.

.. Return to BlueXP workloads and open the Credentials page from the menu icon to verify that the new credentials are in progress, or that they have been added.

.Result

You can now use the credentials when creating an FSx for ONTAP working environment.
